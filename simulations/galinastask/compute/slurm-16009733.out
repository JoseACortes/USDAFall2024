  comment.  photonuclear physics may be needed (phys:p).
 
  warning.  f8 tally unreliable since neutron transport nonanalog.
 comment. using random number generator  1, initial seed = 1245324321          
  comment.  total nubar used if fissionable isotopes are present.
  comment.           6 surfaces were deleted for being the same as others.
  comment.  threading will be used when possible in portions of mcnp6.
  comment.  threading will be used for n/p/e table physics.
  comment.  threading will generally not be used for model physics.
  comment.  unresolved resonances with variance reduction with f8 tally.
  warning.  Force analog capture for pulse height tallies
  warning.  Pulse-height tally variance reduction forced off. F8 tallies not reliable.
