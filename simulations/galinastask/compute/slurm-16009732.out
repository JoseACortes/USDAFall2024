  comment.  total nubar used if fissionable isotopes are present.
  comment.  electron importances have been set equal to 1.
  comment.           6 surfaces were deleted for being the same as others.
  warning.  last time bin of tally       78 is less than time cutoff.
  warning.  no de/df for tally 6 referenced on FT PHL.
  comment.  threading will be used when possible in portions of mcnp6.
  comment.  threading will be used for n/p/e table physics.
